  abstract = {[We test a Wall Street investment strategy, "pairs trading," with daily data over 1962-2002. Stocks are matched into pairs with minimum distance between normalized historical prices. A simple trading rule yields average annualized excess returns of up to 11\% for self-financing portfolios of pairs. The profits typically exceed conservative transaction-cost estimates. Bootstrap results suggest that the "pairs" effect differs from previously documented reversal profits. Robustness of the excess returns indicates that pairs trading profits from temporary mispricing of close substitutes. We link the profitability to the presence of a common factor in the returns, different from conventional risk measures.]},

This article extends previous research in another direction: the combination of forecasting techniques (Neural Networks) and multi-criteria decision making methods (Electre III). The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of multi-step-ahead forecasts. It leads to major changes in the trading system and raises new empirical and methodological questions. The results of an application based on S\&P 100 Index stocks are promising: this methodology could be a powerful tool for pairs selection in a highly non-linear environment.},

  abstract = {Pairs trading is one of the most commonly used market neutral strategies. Over the last few years, several hedge funds have used different ways to successfully implement this trading strategy. The most extensively used techniques (correlation, distance, stochastic, stochastic differential residual and cointegration) use different methodologies and statistical tools to determine the two key elements of the strategy: pairs selection and the establishment of the long-term relationship between them. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the process of selecting pairs and determining the residual series using each one of the different techniques and comparing the outputs. Results indicate that far from being differentiated systems, relationships exist between the various techniques in terms of pairs selection and residual series creation. However, some techniques are more efficient at creating residual series than others, which then means that these techniques would have the highest probabilities of generating profits. The analysis concludes that cointegration is the most efficient method of structuring a pairs trading strategy.},

  shorttitle = {A New Approach to Statistical Arbitrage},
  abstract = {Statistical arbitrage strategies are typically based on models of returns. We introduce a new statistical arbitrage strategy based on dynamic factor models of prices. Our objective in this paper is to exploit the mean-reverting properties of prices reported in the literature. We do so because, to capture the same information using a return-based factor model, a much larger number of lags would be needed, leading to inaccurate parameter estimation. To empirically test the relative performance of return-based and price-based models, we construct portfolios (long-short, long-only, and equally weighted) based on the forecasts generated by two dynamic factor models. Using the stock of companies included in the S\&P 500 index for constructing portfolios, the empirical analysis statistically tests the relative forecasting performance using the Diebold–Mariano framework and performing the test for statistical arbitrage proposed by Hogan et al. (2004). Our results show that prices allow for significantly more accurate forecasts than returns and pass the test for statistical arbitrage. We attribute this finding to the mean-reverting properties of stock prices. The high level of forecasting accuracy using price-based factor models has important theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with a pairs trading rule. The idea is to monitor two historically correlated securities. When divergence is underway, i.e., one stock moves up while the other moves down, a pairs trade is entered which consists of a pair to short the outperforming stock and to long the underperforming one. Such a strategy bets the “spread” between the two would eventually converge. In this paper, a difference of the pair is governed by a mean-reverting model. The objective is to trade the pair so as to maximize an overall return. A fixed commission cost is charged with each transaction. In addition, a stop-loss limit is imposed as a state constraint. The associated HJB equations (quasi-variational inequalities) are used to characterize the value functions. It is shown that the solution to the optimal stopping problem can be obtained by solving a number of quasi-algebraic equations. We provide a set of sufficient conditions in terms of a verification theorem. Numerical examples are reported to demonstrate the results.},

We build on the model of Liu and Timmermann (2013) and include transaction costs, which impose additional limits to the implementation of such convergence trade strategy. We show that the presence of transaction costs could reveal an endogenous stop-loss concern in a certain economy, which affects the optimal policy of the arbitrageur in significant ways. Using pairs of dual-listed Chinese stock shares as samples and a pairs trading strategy based on standard deviation of the spread as benchmark, we demonstrate the efficiency of the strategy implied by our model. Several extensions of our model are also discussed.},
